## 📦 Requirements
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- A computer with Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- Node.js installed on your system. If you do not have it, you can download it from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

## ⚙️ How to Run the Application
Once you have downloaded and installed the software, follow these steps:

1. Open your command line interface (Terminal on macOS/Linux or CMD/PowerShell on Windows).
2. Navigate to the folder where you installed the program. Use the `cd` command followed by the path to the folder. For example:
   ```
   cd path/to/asciidoc-to-html-convert
   ```
3. Run the script by typing the following command:
   ```
   node convert.js path/to/yourfile.adoc
   ```

Replace `path/to/yourfile.adoc` with the actual path to your AsciiDoc file. After running the command, the script will generate an HTML file in the same directory.

## 🧐 Example Usage
To clarify the usage, here is an example:

1. Suppose your AsciiDoc file is named `example.adoc` and is located in your Documents folder.
2. You would type this command:
   ```
   node convert.js ~/Documents/example.adoc
   ```
3. After running the command, an HTML file named `example.html` will be created in your Documents folder.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues during the installation or running of the application, consider the following:
